# LIDAR_ROS
______
This repo is a lite 3D lidar controled by a raspberry pi using ROS. Recently, lidar has been a heated topic among autonomous driving area; however, the commercial lidar products on the market are expensive. The goal of this project is to build a lite lidar system using buget parts. The core parts used in this project is a TOF(time of flight) sensor, stepper motor and servo. ROS is used as the operating system to pipe data through sensors programmed in different language and point cloud visulization.
