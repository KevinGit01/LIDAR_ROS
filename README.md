# LIDAR_ROS
______
This repo is a lite 3D lidar controled by a raspberry pi using ROS. Recently, lidar has been a heated topic among autonomous driving area; however, all the commercial lidar on the market are expensive. The goal of this project is to build a budget lidar using buget parts. The core parts used in this project is a TOF(time of flight) sensor, stepper motor and servo. ROS is used as the operating system to synchronize and piping data through sensors programmed in different language.
